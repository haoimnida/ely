            <p>Ever since I've met you, I had this comforting feeling; that I have known you for a long timeâ€”it's like we are soulmates and we are meant to be together. As long as I'm with you, I feel safe and comfortable. Our love goes deeper and deeper! you've gone through a lot, we've gone through hardships, even after all that we still love each other. I love you forever, Ely!</p>
